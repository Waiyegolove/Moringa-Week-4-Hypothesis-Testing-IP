On a given weekday, the average number of vehicles (BlueCars, Utilib and Utilib_14) taken is more than the average number of vehicles being returned.
On a given day, the number of BlueCars taken is more than the total combined number of Utilib and Utilib_14 cars.
The number of vehicles taken in postal code 75015 is equal to the number of vehicles taken in postal code 75017.
